Code Execution Technologies
- On the web server: This code has full access to the web server and any databases attached to it.
- On the user's web browser: Run's in the client's browser and responds quickly to user actions but is 
more limited to what it can accomplish without interacting with the web server.

AJAX
- Asynchronous Javascript and XML is a technology that enables browsers to communicate with web servers asynchronously by using the
XmlHttpRequest object without refreshing the page.

Angular
- Front-end framework that allows you to build web applications and solve common development challenges.
- Written entirely in TypeScript and is a superset of JavaScript that was created by Microsoft
-

React
- JS library dedicated to building user interfaces. Making interactive UI and designing views while speeding ut the dev cycle.
- React Native is a framework that is based on React and JS and allows developers to create high performing mobile applications.
